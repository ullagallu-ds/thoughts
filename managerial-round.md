# Manager Round

1. How can you handle a critial production outage?
Access the impact what exactly effected which microservice causes the issue how many users what users effected like notify the stake holders 

2. How do you resolve a conflicts in a devops team?
technical differences what exactly miscommunication encourage open discussion team meetings listen both party perspectives 
integration strategies deployment strategies check lists 

3. Managing mauliple issues simultaneously
need to prioritize task first of all task deligation based on expertise they can assign ask help from them JIRA 
quite more important is time management complete work ontime

4. Rolling back a deployment with major bugs
- use blue green deployment testing throughly 
- identity the RCA
- identify gaps in CI/CD,QA  code review process 
5. Disagreeing with a technical decision
make sure a prototypes like proof of conecpt some collaboration discuss our designs and thoughts like architecture diagrams explain what will be the business impact  we can compromise if we needed finally balance if required 
6. Onboarding new DevOps Engineers
- strucutred trainning
- give architectual diagrams and documents pass the require knoledge to get know and understand about project full flow IAC,pipelines monitoring, logging ,tracing
7. Balancing speed and security 
left shift 
8. handling security risks under release pressure
- risk assesment
9. Dealing with developers resists to devops
- expalin the benefits of devops
- faster release and les bugs 
- demoonstrate automation 













# How can you handle a critical production outage?

When answering **"How can you handle a critical production outage?"**, structure your response in a clear, logical way that shows your problem-solving skills, technical expertise, and ability to stay calm under pressure.  

---

### **1. Acknowledge the Severity & Stay Calm**  
- "In a critical production outage, the first priority is to stay calm and follow a structured approach to minimize downtime and restore services as quickly as possible."

### **2. Incident Response Process**  
#### **Step 1: Identify & Acknowledge the Issue**  
- **Monitor & Alerting**: Check monitoring tools (Prometheus, CloudWatch, ELK, Grafana) for alerts and logs.  
- **Reproduce the Issue**: If possible, try to reproduce the issue in a non-production environment.  

#### **Step 2: Immediate Containment (Mitigation)**  
- **Rollback / Failover**: If a recent deployment caused the issue, consider rolling back using GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, or Terraform.  
- **Scaling / Restarting**: If resource exhaustion is the issue, restart services or scale up instances in Kubernetes, ECS, or EC2.  
- **Traffic Rerouting**: If using AWS ALB, Route 53, or Istio, redirect traffic to healthy instances or regions.  

#### **Step 3: Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**  
- **Check Logs & Metrics**: Use ELK, CloudWatch, or `kubectl logs` for insights.  
- **Network & Database Checks**: Verify DNS, VPC, firewall, and database health.  
- **Application & Deployment Issues**: Review recent deployments and code changes.  

#### **Step 4: Permanent Fix & Prevention**  
- **Patch the Issue**: Apply a permanent fix in a staging environment first.  
- **Improve Monitoring & Alerts**: Adjust Prometheus alerts or CloudWatch alarms to detect similar issues earlier.  
- **Update Documentation**: Add details to incident response playbooks for future handling.  

### **3. Post-Incident Review**  
- "Once the issue is resolved, I conduct a post-mortem analysis, document learnings, and improve processes to prevent recurrence."

### **Example Answer** (Short & Impactful)  
*"In a critical production outage, I follow a structured incident response. First, I assess alerts using monitoring tools like Prometheus and CloudWatch. Then, I quickly contain the issueâ€”by rolling back, scaling services, or rerouting traffic via ALB or Istio. Next, I analyze logs and metrics for root cause identification and apply a permanent fix after testing in staging. Finally, I document the findings and improve monitoring to prevent future incidents. Throughout, I ensure clear communication with stakeholders to provide updates on resolution progress."*
