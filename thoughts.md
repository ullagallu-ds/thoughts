🔹 Challenge 1: Write a simple Bash script that prints “Hello DevOps” along with the current date and time.
🔹 Challenge 2: Create a script that checks if a website (e.g., https://www.learnxops.com) is reachable using curl or ping. Print a success or failure message.
🔹 Challenge 3: Write a script that takes a filename as an argument, checks if it exists, and prints the content of the file accordingly.
🔹 Challenge 4: Create a script that lists all running processes and writes the output to a file named process_list.txt.
🔹 Challenge 5: Write a script that installs multiple packages at once (e.g., git, vim, curl). The script should check if each package is already installed before attempting installation.
🔹 Challenge 6: Create a script that monitors CPU and memory usage every 5 seconds and logs the results to a file.
🔹 Challenge 7: Write a script that automatically deletes log files older than 7 days from /var/log.
🔹 Challenge 8: Automate user account creation – Write a script that takes the username as an argument, checks, if the user exists, gives the message “user already exists“ else creates a new user, adds it to a “devops“ group, and sets up a default home directory.
🔹 Challenge 9: Use awk or sed in a script to process a log file and extract only error messages.
🔹 Challenge 10: Set up a cron job that runs a script to back up (zip/tar) a directory daily.
💡 Bonus Challenge: Customize your Bash prompt to display the current user and working directory. (Hint: export PS1="\u@\h:\w\$ "), try to make it permanent, so terminal closing and opening don’t default!

Interviewer: "A pod is not terminating. What could be the issue, and how would you troubleshoot it?"
me: "First, I’d check the pod’s status using kubectl get pods. If it's stuck in the Terminating state, there could be a few reasons—like finalizers, stuck volumes, or a container that isn’t shutting down properly."

Interviewer: "Okay, how would you dig deeper?"
me: "I’d describe the pod with kubectl describe pod <pod-name> to look at events and see if Kubernetes is waiting on something, like a volume detachment. I’d also check logs with kubectl logs <pod-name> --all-containers to see if a process inside the container is hanging."

Interviewer: "What if it's still not terminating?"
me: "I’d check for finalizers using kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o json | jq '.metadata.finalizers'. If a finalizer is preventing deletion, I’d manually remove it with a patch. If it’s a deployment-managed pod, I’d scale down the deployment to avoid automatic restarts."

Interviewer: "What about force deletion?"
me: "If nothing else works, I’d use kubectl delete pod <pod-name> --force --grace-period=0, but only as a last resort since it bypasses graceful shutdown mechanisms. Before doing that, I'd ensure there are no dependencies like a mounted volume that could cause issues."

Key Takeaway:

 The key takeaway is to demonstrate a structured, systematic approach while being technically sound and efficient in troubleshooting."
